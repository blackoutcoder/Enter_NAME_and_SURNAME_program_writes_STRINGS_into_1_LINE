Enter_NAME_and_SURNAME_program_writes_STRINGS_into_1_LINE
Check() Method Added - Method check if an Entered string is not an <int> type, and returns an alert message or the result.
Need to upgrade Check() method in next version by adding "While" loop to make program repeat the Name and Surname entry until the type will be correct.
Also need to Add Termination() method to exit program by typing "stop".
